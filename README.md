# Parallax Challenge
Learning challenge

## New day, new challenge
Today they are serving us with a parallax challenge. Our coaches provided us with some images we can use to create a parallax animation.
So first I want to see how this parallax is going to work, how it ticks. So I will first start off with what we got and later on edit it and make it my own.

## To DO
- Animate the background
  - [x] Ground moves fastest
  - [x] Place the other background images and see what fits best
    - [x] Apparently you can just place them in order
  - [x] The sky is static
- [x] A page with a moving background that looks natural
- [x] Add the running character
  - [x] Make him jump
  - [x] Change his appearance to a jumping character
- [x] Add an obstacle
  - [x] Make it go from left to right
- [ ] Add collision
- [ ] Check if you hit the obstacle
