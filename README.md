# Parallax Challenge
Learning challenge

## New day, new challenge
Today they are serving us with a parallax challenge. Our coaches provided us with some images we can use to create a parallax animation.
So first I want to see how this parallax is going to work, how it ticks. So I will first start off with what we got and later on edit it and make it my own.

## To DO
- Animate the background
  - [ ] Ground moves fastest
  - [ ] Place the other background images and see what fits best
  - [ ] The sky is static
- [ ] A page with a moving background that looks natural
- Enhance the page to my liking
